1. Add methods to NeuralNetPlayer to turn on learning and saving of nets.

2. For the command-line interface, perhaps there should be a magic name, "human",
  which signifies a HumanPlayer.  Alterntively, if there is no .w extension, then
  that could be interpreted as the name of a human player.

3. Add a Player that does one-roll lookahead.  Maybe more.
